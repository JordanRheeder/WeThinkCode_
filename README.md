Coursework for WeThinkCode_

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First year consists of:

● Exam preparation

● LIBFT         : First project which provides the tools to build the bigger projects such as Get_next_line, etc.

● Get_next_line : Read data from the file descriptor until it reaches buffer size, new line character or EOL character.

● Push_swap     : First project for the algorithm branch. We must sort a two stacks of varying sizes, 3, 5, 100 and 500.
                  However, my implementation can handle various other sizes if needed.
